## Overview

Vitruvius is a decentralized, peer-to-peer file synchronization platform built on a **zero-knowledge encryption model**. Unlike cloud sync solutions (Dropbox, Google Drive) or existing P2P tools (Syncthing), Vitruvius encrypts files **on the source device before transmission**, ensuring that no relay node, server, or third party can ever read your data.

Named after Leonardo da Vinci's *Vitruvian Man* — a study of ideal proportion and balance — Vitruvius brings balance between **convenience and privacy**, giving you seamless file sync without sacrificing control over your data.

### Key Features

- **🔐 Zero-Knowledge Encryption** — Files are encrypted client-side with ChaCha20-Poly1305 before leaving your device. Sync nodes see only opaque ciphertext.
- **🌐 Fully Decentralized** — Built on libp2p for peer discovery and direct device-to-device sync. No central server to trust or compromise.
- **📜 Version History** — Content-addressed storage with BLAKE3 hashing preserves every file version and enables point-in-time recovery.
- **♻️ Deduplication** — Identical content blocks are stored only once across all files, saving storage and bandwidth.
- **🦀 Written in Rust** — Memory safety and performance guaranteed at compile time, with no garbage collection overhead.

## Why Vitruvius?

| Feature | Dropbox | Google Drive | Syncthing | **Vitruvius** |
|---------|---------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| Zero-Knowledge Encryption | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | **✓** |
| Decentralized (No Central Server) | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | **✓** |
| Works Offline / LAN-only | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | **✓** |
| Content-Addressed Version History | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | **✓** |
| Automatic Deduplication | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | **✓** |
| Free & Open Source | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | **✓** |

**The Difference:** Syncthing encrypts *in transit*. Vitruvius encrypts *before transit*. This means even a compromised relay cannot decrypt your files.

## Target Use Cases

Vitruvius is designed for individuals and organizations that handle sensitive data and cannot afford to trust third-party cloud providers:

- **Legal firms** syncing confidential case files
- **Medical practices** sharing patient records across locations
- **Accounting offices** handling sensitive financial data
- **Creative agencies** syncing large media files without cloud storage fees
- **Privacy-conscious individuals** who want control over their personal data

---

## Project Goals

This is a **final-year Bachelor project** with three core objectives:

1. **Academic** — Demonstrate understanding of distributed systems, cryptography, and systems programming in Rust
2. **Technical** — Build a working prototype that proves zero-knowledge file sync is feasible and usable
3. **Commercial** — Validate the concept with real users and explore incubation through the University of Tlemcen's entrepreneurship program

## Security Notice

⚠️ **Vitruvius is pre-alpha software under active development.** It has not been audited by professional cryptographers and should **not** be used for production data or any scenario where data loss or security compromise would have serious consequences.

The encryption implementation uses well-established libraries (ChaCha20-Poly1305 via Rust's `chacha20poly1305` crate), but the overall protocol and key management strategy have not been independently verified.

**Use at your own risk during the development phase.**
